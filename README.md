# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and development journey after graduating from my education.  
The portfolio is continuously improved and serves as both a presentation platform and a learning project.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to:

- Improve my JavaScript and React skills
- Build and deploy a real-world fullstack application
- Strengthen my understanding of frontend–backend communication
- Gain hands-on experience with Node.js, TypeScript, and deployment workflows

---

## Tech Stack

### Client Side
- **React**
- **Bootstrap CSS**

Bootstrap was chosen due to its simplicity and built-in components. Since I had prior experience with it, it allowed me to focus more on application logic and structure rather than styling complexity.

### Server Side
- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Express.Js**



Earlier in development, project data was fetched directly from GitHub’s API on the client side. The backend architecture now allows better performance, security, and flexibility for future improvements such as caching or database integration.
---

## Deployment

The application is deployed using the following services:

- **Frontend:** Netlify
- **Backend:** Render

This setup allows the frontend and backend to be deployed independently, making the application easier to maintain and scale.

SHALL BE NOTED: The startup from render can be a little bit slow duo to being a free version of use, so it may take some seconds for the fetching of projects and about section.

## Features

- Fully responsive design
- Contact form with email functionality (EmailJs)
- Projects page
- Modular React components
- Clean and minimal UI

---

## What I Learned

- Building and architecting fullstack application
- React component architecture.
- Node.js backend development with TypeScript
- Implementing third-party integrations like EmailJs.
- Handling deployment pipelines on Netlify and Render.
