Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and development journey after graduating from my education.
The portfolio is continuously improved and serves as both a presentation platform and a learning project.

Purpose

The main goal of this project was to:

Improve my JavaScript and React skills

Build and deploy a real-world fullstack application

Strengthen my understanding of frontend–backend communication

Gain hands-on experience with Node.js, TypeScript, and deployment workflows

Tech Stack
Client Side

React

Bootstrap CSS

Bootstrap was chosen due to its simplicity and built-in components. Since I had prior experience with it, it allowed me to focus more on application logic and structure rather than styling complexity.

Server Side

Node.js

TypeScript

NodeMailer

The backend is responsible for handling email functionality and serves as a scalable foundation for future features.

Deployment

The application is deployed using the following services:

Frontend: Netlify

Backend: Render

This setup allows the frontend and backend to be deployed independently, making the application easier to maintain and scale. Environment variables are handled securely on the server side.

Features

Fully responsive design (desktop, tablet, and mobile)

Contact form with email functionality using NodeMailer

Projects page displaying my work

Modular React components

Clean and minimal UI

Backend Overview

The backend is built with Node.js and TypeScript and currently handles:

Sending emails from the contact form via NodeMailer

API logic used by the frontend

Secure handling of environment variables

Earlier in development, project data was fetched directly from GitHub’s API on the client side. The backend architecture now allows better performance, security, and flexibility for future improvements such as caching or database integration.

What I Learned

Building and structuring a fullstack application

React component architecture and state handling

Creating and deploying a Node.js backend

Using NodeMailer for email handling

Deploying applications to Netlify and Render

Managing environment variables and production builds

Future Improvements

Add database or CMS for managing projects

Improve animations and UI transitions

Implement caching for API responses

Better SEO and performance optimizations
