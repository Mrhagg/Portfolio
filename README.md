  <h1>My personal portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Been working on my personal portfolio now for a while after i graduated from my education.</h2>
  <h3>I have still a bit to do on this project but development is in the making of it.</h3>
  <p>When i was gonna start build my portfolio i wanted to build it with React JavaScript duo to the lack of knowledge when it comes to JavaScript in general, so i wanted to get a bit better in the stack overall which made it easy to choose this framework to build with.I was keen on trying Tailwind CSS but since i been using bootstrap CSS the majority of my time programming i choose it in the end of all for the simplicty it brings with built in stylings for certain components.</p>
