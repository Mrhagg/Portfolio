## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to:

- Improve my JavaScript and React skills
- Build and deploy a real-world fullstack application
- Strengthen my understanding of frontend–backend communication
- Gain hands-on experience with Node.js, TypeScript, and deployment workflows

---

## Tech Stack

### Client Side
- **React**
- **Bootstrap CSS**

Bootstrap was chosen due to its simplicity and built-in components. Since I had prior experience with it, it allowed me to focus more on application logic and structure rather than styling complexity.

### Server Side
- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **NodeMailer**

The backend is responsible for handling email functionality and serves as a scalable foundation for future features.

---

## Deployment

The application is deployed using the following services:

- **Frontend:** Netlify
- **Backend:** Render

This setup allows the frontend and backend to be deployed independently, making the application easier to maintain and scale.
